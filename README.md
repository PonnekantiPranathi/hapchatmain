## The channel that we have created in Agora console needs a token that will be re-generated for every 24 hours for our project. The channel name and appid remains the same as in the code
## First make a simple http server with the command with whatever port we want the code to be run on(here used 8080) - python3 -m http.server 8080
## Then run 'ngrok http 8080' in another terminal to get a public link generated for the app. (The generated link can be used to join by any participant)
## To become the host , one has to enter 'host' along with the name (Example - sindhuhost, pranhost etc)
